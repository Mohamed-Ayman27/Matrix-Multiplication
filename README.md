# Complex Matrix Multiplication Using Systolic Array with Hardware Reuse and Pipelining

## Project Overview
This project implements a complex matrix multiplication algorithm using a systolic array architecture. The algorithm is optimized for efficient hardware usage through hardware reuse and pipelining techniques. These optimizations reduce the complexity of the multipliers required while preserving the number of clock cycles needed to compute the results, enhancing both performance and resource efficiency.

## Features
- **Systolic Array Architecture**: Leverages a systolic array structure for parallel and efficient matrix multiplication, ideal for hardware implementations.
- **Hardware Reuse Optimization**: Reuses hardware components within the systolic array to minimize resource utilization.
- **Pipelining for Performance**: Incorporates pipelining to enable continuous data flow, reducing latency without increasing the clock cycle count.
- **Reduced Multiplier Complexity**: The algorithm uses simpler multipliers, optimized for hardware constraints, while maintaining computational accuracy and efficiency.
- **Efficient Clock Cycle Utilization**: Despite the reduced complexity of hardware components, the number of clock cycles required for matrix multiplication remains unchanged.

## Implementation Details
1. **Systolic Array Design**: 
   - The systolic array structure enables parallel processing, where data flows through a grid of processing elements (PEs). Each PE performs partial computations that are combined to produce the final result.

2. **Hardware Reuse**:
   - Hardware components are reused within each PE, allowing multiple operations to be performed on the same hardware over time. This reuse reduces the total number of components required, leading to a more resource-efficient design.

3. **Pipelining**:
   - By introducing pipelining stages, data can be loaded and processed simultaneously across different parts of the array. This approach minimizes idle time, allowing for a smooth and continuous flow of data through the array.

4. **Optimized Multipliers**:
   - Less complex multipliers are utilized within each PE, reducing the hardware complexity without compromising performance. The simplified multipliers are capable of handling complex data inputs and are optimized for the pipelined structure.
